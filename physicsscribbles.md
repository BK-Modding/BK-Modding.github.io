# Physics Scribbles

> ‘A physicist is simply an atom’s way of looking at itself’ — Niels Bohr

Just random physics writings I do in my free time. Content here can range from scribblings of derivations and quick notes to well thought out articles with a coherent goal of communicating a set of ideas.

This blog had its origins on [Quora](https://physicsscribbles.quora.com/) in 2018 before being moved to [Medium](https://medium.com/physics-scribbles) in 2019. Unsatisfied with the blogging facilities provided on these platforms (Medium doesn't have LaTeX support), I've moved the blog once more and hopefully for the last time. All the posts from those versions of the blog will be moved over here as time goes on.
