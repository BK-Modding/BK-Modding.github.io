Hello There! My name is Baalateja Kataru, but you can call me Baala. I'm a Physics major, Software Developer, and Freelancer. 
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelors in Physics with a minor in Mathematics at KREA University.

My first passion is Physics. My interest is biased towards Theoretical Physics, and some of my favorite topics are:

- Astronomy and Astrophysics
- Quantum and Particle Physics
- Special and General Relativity
- Cosmology
- Analytical Mechanics
- Electrodynamics
- Numerical Methods/Computational Physics

I'm also a self-taught Software Developer.

Apart from learning and discussing Physics, I love writing about Physics and communicating the beauty of the field to the world. 
I've been blogging on topics of Theoretical Physics on sites like Quora and Medium since 2018. If you wander around this site, you'll run into some of my posts on Physics and Computer Science.
